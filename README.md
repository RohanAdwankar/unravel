Loading the model into the browser should take ~1 minute but subsequent visits should take ~1 second.
This means that if you download the HTML file and load the model once, on subsequent visits you can use the AI offline.
Inference times will depend on local hardware and require WebGPU since the model is running purely in the browser without an extenral server.

There is a hot potato mode where the toggle closest to your cursor is unraveled.

The idea of this project was to explore new designs on ways to interact with LLMs. One useful way is to use it is to brainstorm ideas for projects, stories, or art where I think the mixing of different words/ideas can help with creativity.
